# MovingSnakeGame

Discription:
This is a Html game written by Javascript. It's quite suitble for practicing your programming skills.
It may not be pretty complicated but very interesting. I remember that I played this kind of game when I was a child.
Now I'm so excited that I can even make a computer game by myself. 

Rules:
Players can press "A, W, D, S" or "right, up, left, down" to control the movement of the snake to eat the 'food'. 
Once the snake gets its food, it will grow longer. But when the snake reaches the wall, or hits its own body, the game is over.
